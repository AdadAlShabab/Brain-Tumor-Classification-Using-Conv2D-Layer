# Brain Tumor Classification Using Conv2D Layer

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of brain tumor images. The model is built using Conv2D layers and trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans to accurately classify images into tumor and non-tumor classes.

## Overview

Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical image analysis, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to automate this classification process, providing a reliable and efficient tool for medical professionals.

## Features

- **Conv2D Layers:** The core of the model architecture consists of Conv2D layers, which are well-suited for image classification tasks, allowing the network to learn hierarchical features.
  
- **Dataset:** The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset comprising brain MRI scans with labeled tumor and non-tumor regions, ensuring robust performance and generalization.

- **Classification:** The trained model is capable of accurately classifying new brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories, enabling quick and reliable diagnosis.
